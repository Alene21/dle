<b> Summary: </b> <i>  Developing deep learning engines (DLEs) for non-parametric modeling and extracting of information from active galactic nuclei (AGN) light-curves (LCs), which are directly related to the scientific objectives of the LSST Exploring transient optical sky. Developed DLEs Jupyter notebooks might be adaptable for modeling of light-curves of other objects, and will be tested on LSST Data Previews, as well as on other datasets through NOIRLab services. </i>


<b>  PROJECT DESCRIPTION, MOTIVATION, AND RELEVANCE TO LSST  </b>

<b> Motivation and relevance. </b> Exploring transient optical sky (ETOS) is among four Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) key science drivers (Ivezić et al. 2019). We are motivated by the ETOS LSST science opportunity No. 14 (see item 14 in section 4, Ivezić et al. 2019), which enables to harness LSST light curves (LC) of active galactic nuclei (AGN) for photometric reverberation mapping (PhotoRM, Chelouche & Daniel 2012). Our goal is to build a deep learning engine (DLE) for LC nonparametric modeling and implementation of the PhotoRM procedure to respond to the observing strategy of the LSST (Jones et al. 2020). Our student has already started experiments of DLE
LC modeling, and pilot results are shown in Figure 1. Here
the DLE has been trained on object 1H0419m577 LC and
produces the predicted points in green. Learned LC will
enable us to improve time-lag determination as a goal of
PhotoRM, but also to hunt for Transient Fueling Events:
Temporary AGNs and Cataclysmic AGN Outbursts (see pp.
369-371 in LSST Collaboration Science book 2009). Further,
our group has already begun PhotoRM calculations and
some initial procedures have been tested in Kovacevic et al.
(submitted 2021). Our DLE will be developed as user-
friendly Jupyter notebooks, in such a way to be adaptable to
other object LC, and tested on LSST Data Previews (e.g.,
DP0). Initial stages of our DLE will be presented as an
ePoster  at the  European Astronomical Society  Annual
Meeting - EAS 2021, subtheme SS32: Machine learning and visualisation in data intensive era (Jun 28 - Jul 2, 2021), and at the 13th SCSLSA Conference (Aug 23-27, 2021). We plan to further disseminate results at international conferences and in peer-reviewed publications.
