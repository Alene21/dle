<b> Summary: </b> Developing deep learning engines (DLEs) for non-parametric modeling and extracting of information from active galactic nuclei (AGN) light-curves (LCs), which are directly related to the scientific objectives of the LSST Exploring transient optical sky. Developed DLEs Jupyter notebooks might be adaptable for modeling of light-curves of other objects, and will be tested on LSST Data Previews, as well as on other datasets through NOIRLab services.
