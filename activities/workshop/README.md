<h3> Title: </h3> 
 Student intro training on Python for data processing of AGN variability within
the Large Survey of Space and Time (LSST) <br>

<h3> Time:  </h3>  March 26, 2022 

<h3> Lecturers:  </h3> <br>
Andjelka Kovacevic, Dragana Ilic, Robert Nikutta, Paula S치nchez S치ez, Isidora
Jankov, Viktor Radovic <br>

<h3> Summary and Topics: </h3> <br>

The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is a 10-year long project of the
Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which will open the window of dynamical Universe and
deliver a 500 petabyte set of images and data (for details see
https://www.lsst.org/). <br>

It is expected that the LSST will observe more than six million of active
galactic nuclei (AGN). AGN are powered by the accretion onto the most compact
objects - supermassive black holes (SMBH). Studying these objects will help us
to understand the physical process in the vicinity of SMBH, probing general
relativity as well as the formation and evolution of galaxies, which are the
main building blocks of the Universe. <br>

This workshop is aimed at students in physics and astronomy majors at all
levels of software development skills (e.g., Python, or other programming
languages). Within this workshop we aim to train students in using Python-based
tools to investigate the variability of AGN and prepare for the coming most
important sky survey, the LSST. The tutorial will also touch on the relevant
mathematical foundations, for instance Fourier transform and cross-correlation
analysis. <br> 

The workshop will be organized in two sessions covering the general
introduction to the LSST and to AGN variability, followed by the presentation
of NOIRLab's Astro Data Lab science platform, which provides open access to
remote compute capabilities and to large datasets, including in the future to
LSST data products. Each presentation will be accompanied with several
tutorials, based on Python and Jupyter notebooks. <br> 

Format: Online, through Zoom Platform  <br>

Material: All preparation materials and connection details will be circulated
to registered participants well in advance. <br>


Participants: Undergraduate and graduate students mostly from the University of
Belgrade and several universities in Ethiopia, but others are welcomed. <br>
