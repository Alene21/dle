INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPILING FORTRAN SOURCE CODE:

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where you downloaded fortran source code (.f90 files)

2. To compile the source code of ZDCF, type into terminal: gfortran zdcf_v2.2.f90 -o zdcf

3. To compile the source code of PLIKE, type into terminal: gfortran plike_v4.0.f90 -o plike

4. You can run those programs from terminal by typing: ./zdcf (or ./plike)

5. Be sure to add these zdcf and plike files to a directory you specified in the PhotoRM notebook (for me, it was ./fortran_dir)
